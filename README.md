# TwScheduleIt

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/tw_schedule_it`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Usage

To install the gem, clone or copy the project, cd into it, and run:

    $ bundle exec rake install

To remove the gem

    $ gem uninstall tw_schedule_it-0.1.0.gem


Alternatively, you can clone this project, cd into it, and run the command line application as so:

    $ bundle exec tw_schedule_it <file>


To use the gem, you'll need to provide it a plain text file with one talk per line, formatted as so:

    Talk name (duration)

Duration should be in minutes, like this `30min` or for lightning talks of 5-minutes, you can simply put `lightning`. Here is a breif example:

    Writing Fast Tests Against Enterprise Rails 60min
    Overdoing it in Python 45min
    Lua for the Masses 30min
    Ruby Errors from Mismatched Gem Versions 45min
    Common Ruby Errors 45min
    Rails for Python Developers lightning 

To run tests

    $ rake features

and

    $ rake spec

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
